# Case study Eniac

### "How to lose your investment fast?"

1. Eniac’s catalogue is 100% tech products and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that the marketplaces Magist works with are a good place for these high-end tech products.

   
   
   **General Facts:**

2. Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? **Are deliveries fast enough?**
